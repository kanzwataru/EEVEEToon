Set of nodes and sample shaders to make NPR shading in Blender Eeevee easier

Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/kanzwataru/EEVEEToon/releases) and download the
latest release. Inside the zip file you'll find another zip which you can add to blender's
add-ons (Edit->User Preferences...->Add-ons->Install Add-on from file...).

This is work in progress, as is Blender 2.8. 

To use it, simply go to the Material tab to append the group nodes.
The Base Nodes are for building custom toon shaders, the Sample Shaders are ready-to-use shader group nodes.
